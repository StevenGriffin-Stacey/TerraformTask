# TerraformTask

Challenge 2

For this part of the task i would set up a task in the Task scheduler, giving it the action to run A .BAT file with the script inside and a trigger for the specified time.
Due to the time on the server i would set this for Sunday at 9pm.
I would then add this to recur every 1 weeks on Monday.

After this I would check to make the task run whether the user is logged on or not and run with Highest privlieges.
